## What are mixed models ?

There are many varieties of mixed models:

* Linear mixed models (LMM)
* Nonlinear mixed models (NLM)
* Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)

We will focus only on Linear mixed models

## What are mixed models ?

Suppose we have a flat that are located in five districts (A, B, C, D, E) and we think that such location will have influence on the price.

Response: Price of flat

Factor: District

Treatments = Levels of a factor: A, B, C, D, E

Effect: Impact of district on Price of flat

* $\mu$ = flat population mean price
* $\mu_{A}$ = flat population mean price in district A
* effect of A = $\mu_{A} - \mu$

## What are mixed models ? - random and fixed effects

Factor effects are either fixed or random:

* **Fixed**: The levels in the study represent all levels of interest
* **Random**: The levels in the study represent only a sample of the levels of interest.

Mixed models have both fixed and random effects.

In our example, district is fixed since A, B, C, D, E are the only levels of interest.

## What are mixed models ? - random and fixed effects

Fixed effect: Something the experimenter directly manipulates and is often repeatable, e.g., drug administration - one group gets drug, one group gets placebo.

Random effect: Source of random variation / experimental units e.g., individuals drawn (at random) from a population for a clinical trial. Random effects estimates the variability


## What are mixed models ?

* A group of units formed so that units within the group are as homogeneous as possible.
* Reduces the effects of variation among experimental units.
* Treatmets are randomly assigned to blocks.

Lets add to the example: Poznań has 5 districts and 42 supporting units (residential areas, Pol. osiedle). Let assume that we randomly choosen n flats within each of 5 districts but we did not used supporting units to stratification. Therefore, not all supporting units are observed in the sample. 

* fixed - districts
* random - supporting units (residential areas)

## What are mixed models ?

Blocking

Now let assume that we only have four type of flats - 1, 2, 3 and 4+ rooms. Then we sample flats in Poznań, but we do not control for coverage of all of 42 supporting units. Then:

* fixed - room
* random - supporting unit (block) effect

## What are mixed models ?


Mixed models contain both fixed and random effects This has several ramifications:

* Using random effects broadens the scope of inference. That is, inferences can be made on a statistical basis to the population from which the levels of the random factor have been drawn.
* Naturally incorporates dependence in the model. Observations that share the same level of the random effects are being modeled as correlated.
* Using random factors often gives more accurate estimates.
* Sophisticated estimation and fitting methods must be used.

## What are mixed models - random intercept model

The basic random intercept model is given by

$$
y_{ij} = \beta + b_i + e_{ij}
$$

where $y_{ij}$ is the dependent variable, $\beta$ is the population mean, $b_i$ is the deviation from the $\beta$ for $i$ level of random error. $e_{ij}$ is a random error.

We assume that

$$
b_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b) 
$$

$$
e_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2) 
$$

## What are mixed models - random intercept model

Our assumptions imply that observations on the same random error are correlated, in fact,

$$
cor = \frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_b+ \sigma^2}
$$

## Mixed models in R

* package lme4 - linear mixed models, function lmer
* package nlme - nonlinear mixed models, function lme

Notation

* (1 | random ) - random intercept
* (x | random ) - random slope
* (1 + x | random ) - random intercept and slope assuming correlation
* (1 | random) + (x-1 | random) - random intercept and slope assuming no correlation
* (1 | random / group ) - hierarchical random intercept model

## Mixed models in R

```{r message=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(PBImisc)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(sjPlot)
data("apartments")
apartments <- tbl_df(apartments)
apartments
```

## Mixed models in R

```{r vis_inspection}
mean_prices <- apartments %>%
  group_by(district) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(m2.price),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean)) 
ggplot(data = mean_prices,
       aes(x = district,
           y = mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat= 'identity')
```

## Mixed models in R

```{r mixed_model}
model_first <- lmer(m2.price ~ 1 + (1 | district),
                    data = apartments)
summary(model_first)
```

## Mixed models in R - coefficients

```{r mixed_model2}
fixef(model_first)
ranef(model_first)
```

## Mixed models in R - coefficients plot

```{r results_plot}
sjp.lmer(model_first,sort.coef=TRUE)
```

## More to go

* random slope
* random slope and intercept
* hierarchical linear model
* within-group heteroscedasticity structure, within-group correlation structure
* spatial heterogenity
